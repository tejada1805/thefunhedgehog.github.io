<h1>Carla Tejada</h1>
	<p>I was born in Puerto Rico, in 1994.
		I moved to Florida in 2006 when I was 12 years old.I love reading. 
    My favorite books to read are true crime books and romance. 
    I enjoy traveling, visiting new cities as well.
		My favorite country so far has been South Korea.
    Their food and the people is the best part. 
    Some of my other hobbies are playing video games, watch K-Dramas, learn new languages and help my husband work on cars. 
    I love history, and have been always interested in the 1940's to 1950's.</p>
    <p>I currently work for the Navy at the Navy Exchange. I am currently working on my degree in Computer programing and
    analysis and I hope to continue working for the Navy or for the Department of Defense after graduation.
    I hope to travel as well to many more countries and explore the world. My favorite food is Korean and Viet. I love cooking, banking and trying ne reciepes that I find. 
    At home, I like to relax, enjoy time with my family and drink my wine. I have 2 shi-tzus their name are Lulu and Bambi. Lulu was adopted from the shelter at 11 months. </p>
